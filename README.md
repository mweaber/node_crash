Node.js is a JavaScript runtime (not a language or framework)
Written in C++

Good things to know:

        Objects, Arrays, Conditional

    HTTP (status codes, headers)
    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
    Arrow Functions

Why use Node?

Event driven, non-blocking I/O* 
Popular
Full stack (MEAN, MERN)

*Non-blocking I/O
